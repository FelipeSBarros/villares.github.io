#### Studies and derivatives of Maeda's [Design By Numbers](https://dbn.media.mit.edu/whatisdbn.html) 26 letter experiment

> ***What is DBN?***

> *Design By Numbers [programming environment] was created for  visual designers and artists as an introduction to computational design.  It is the result of a continuing endeavor by Professor John Maeda to  teach the “idea” of computation to designers and artists.*

*As I was reading the Design By Numbers book for my master's  degree about a year ago I was amazed by a set of DBN letter "commands"  written by the author, John Maeda, available as a .dbn code file as well  (I didn't have to type them in) so I  wrote a sketch that would  translate them into Processing equivalentes. In the last few weeks I  decided to make a pixel font capturing the DBN letters and to tried to  re-imagine it as a scalable font (adding with shamelessly some glifs). I  documented it all in this repository: github.com/villares/DesignByNumbers-alphabet*
 
 Lendo o livro Design By Numbers, sobre o ambiente de programação de  mesmo nome, no começo do ano passado para o meu mestrado, fiquei  impressionado com um conjunto de "comandos" de desenhar letras escrito  pelo autor, John Maeda, e resolvi escrever um sketch que traduz o código  de DBN para Processing. Nas últimas semanas decidi fazer uma fonte que  captura os pixels das letras do alfabedo DBN e tentei re-imaginálas como  uma fonte escalável (acrescentando em ambas uns glifos que duvido que  estejam a altura). Documentei isso tudo neste repositório: *: github.com/villares/DesignByNumbers-alphabet*
