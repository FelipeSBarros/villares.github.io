I'm a teacher and I work exploring digital tools. After having studied architecture and urbanism at FAU-USP I was a partner of TI Lab / ProBooks (between 2000 and 2015). I teach at Escola da Cidade (architecture and urbanism school in São Paulo) since 2005, currently on 'Meios Digitais' disciplines.

I work with themes ranging from digital manufacturing to programming for architects, designers, visual artists, children, young people and the general pubic. I started in 2017 studies for a master's degree at FEC / Unicamp.

I have experience in teaching short and long term lectures and courses. More recently
