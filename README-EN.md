I'm a teacher and I work exploring digital tools. After graduating in architecture and urbanism at FAU-USP, I was a partner of TI Lab / ProBooks (between 2000 and 2015). I teach at Escola da Cidade (architecture and urbanism school in São Paulo) since 2005, currently on 'Digital media' disciplines.

I work with themes ranging from digital manufacturing to programming for architects, designers, visual artists, children, young people and the general pubic. I started in 2017 my studies for a master's degree at FEC / Unicamp. I have experience in presenting lectures, teaching short and long duration courses.
