I'm a teacher and I work with digital tools. After graduating in architecture and urbanism at FAU-USP, in 2000, I was a partner of TI Lab / ProBooks until 2015. I teach at Escola da Cidade architectural school in São Paulo since 2005, currently on 'Digital media' disciplines.

I work with themes ranging from digital manufacturing to programming for architects, designers, visual artists, children, young people and the general pubic. I started in 2017 my studies for a master's degree at FEC / Unicamp. I have experience in presenting lectures, teaching short and long duration courses.
