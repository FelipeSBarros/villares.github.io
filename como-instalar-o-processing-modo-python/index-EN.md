# How to install o Processing Python Mode

[[Portuguese-language version](/index.md)]

[**Processing**](http://processsing.org) is a Free and Open Source (FLOSS) programming platform started in 2001 by Casey Reas e Ben Fry, widely used by artists and  to teach coding in a visual context. The Processing IDE is a text editor for code that can quickly execute your programs, called *sketches*.

Standard Processing is **Java** based and there are two other projects supported by the Processing Foundation that you might want to try:

-   [P5\*JS](https://p5js.org/) (a **JavaScript** library );
-   [Processing **Python** Mode](https://py.processing.org/) (Jython based).

Both can be added to the traditional IDE. So let's finaly see **how to install Processing Python Mode** (which hopefully is the reason you are reading this).

Visit downloads at the Processing site (<http://www.processing.org/download>), and choose your OS.

There is no installer, you just unzip/extract a folder. This is how it looks on Windows:

On Mac OS it's almos the same, and on Linux, you can fire a Terminal window on the decompressed downloaded folder and type *./processing*
(you may also want to execute *install.sh* that should creat a nice desktop shortcut to Processing)

Once the Processing is launched, look for the modes menu item *Add modeâ€¦*

Press *Install* to get tge Python Mode \[If this fails, see more instructions down below].

A *Processing* folder will be created under the user's *Documents* on Windos and MacOs (On Linux the folder is called *sketchbook*), there you'll find your *sketches* (programms), tools, modes and libraries. This is how it looks when you've finished:

Obs: If you are under some restrictive proxy our without Internet acess you can manually download [PyhtonMode.zip](http://py.processing.org/3/PythonMode.zip) and manualy copy it (on Windows & Mac OS) under *Documentos &gt; Processing &gt; modes &gt;* PythonMode. On Linux, under your *sketchbook* folder.

PS: How about a sketch to test it?
