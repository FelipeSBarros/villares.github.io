Unicode is one of the contemporary era marvels, to try and encode all human made glyphs and allow collaboration between peoples is amazing. We benefit everyday from Free and Open Source software and fonts. This works tries to explore and reinterpret GNU Unifont pixel font that aims to cover large parts of the Basic Multilingual Plane as a source of playful patterns.



This idea started in sketch-a-day work from 2018, using Processing Python mode, and was converted in 2023 to run using the py5 Python library (a new tool that combines
Processing 4 Java graphics infrastructure and modern Python 3), it picks data from the GNU Unifont pixel font (https://unifoundry.com/unifont/) and reinterprets it (recodes) as source for pattern and glyph exploration.
